This directory contains outputs generated by the experiments executed from
`notebooks/` that are located in `test/`.

Also the audio files generated as examples of "musical words" presented
in the paper (those with names beginning with "Table4_") can be found inside
`/audios`.  In addition, the directory includes a few extra examples not shown
in the paper â€” randomly created *non-gregorian* "musical words".
